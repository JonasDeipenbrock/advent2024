# Advent of Code 2024

## Setup

Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/).

Then you can run the daily tasks by calling `deno run dev`.

## Frameworks and Notes

This year im not using python but didn't want to go to crazy so i went with TS and sprinkled in something new by using Deno for the first time.

I'm also trying to use some of the standart libraries of Deno/JSR, [@std](https://jsr.io/@std). 

I'm also using some other syntax sugar libraries:
- [magic-regexp](https://regexp.dev/)
